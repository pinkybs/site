              <p>"iDesign®-guided iLASIK® is a reflection of the latest laser technique customized for the eyes upon the unique demands of the patient, which can improve visual quality and bring better postoperative experiences to the patient."<br>"With the emergence of iDesign®, a brand-new standard has been established for all refractive surgeries. iLASIK® properly treats the human eyes by measuring the aberrations with unprecedented accuracy and precisely designing the excimer laser keratectomy. It is to refractive surgery what CPU is to a computer."<br>The latest report of "International Journal of Ophthalmology" showed that iLASIK® improves the patient's night vision and driving performance, which might be compromised by routine surgeries.<br>"My patient who underwent iLASIK® said after surgery that they received a special gift, and even regretted not coming sooner. They become more confident, feel more comfortable and secure. They said that it is really great to see the clock clearly when wake up in the morning!"<br>"Based on some of my research data, iLASIK® has been approved by the U.S. army and NASA for application in the air force, even in pilots and astronauts. If iLASIK® is performed, they can recover soon and perform their duties right after two weeks."</p>

"More than 30 million patients worldwide have undergone LASIK. It has been performed for over 10 million Chinese patients. Such a technique has made its presence in China for more than 20 years. It was approved by the FDA and CFDA after many animal and human studies were conducted. It demonstrates that LASIK is safe."<br>

 "By iDesign®, five examinations are performed simultaneously, which allows more accurate comparison."
"With technically superior iDesign® on hand, we may achieve the visual acuity of 1.2, or even 1.5 after surgery without glasses and improve night vision for patients. It not only gives me better eyesight, but makes my life much better. "</p>

              <p>"Except a very few myopic patients unsuitable for laser treatment, a majority is suitable for iLASIK®."<br>
"In a 10-year follow-up retrospective study of a large sample size in the United States, the patients' satisfaction rate reaches 95.4%, which is the highest in all selective surgeries."<br>
"The proportion of the ophthalmologists who perform refractive surgeries and undergo LASIK themselves is 1/3 to 1/4. The proportion of their relatives who undergo LASIK is 25%-28%, higher than that of the normal population. In our department, most of the myopic ophthalmologists underwent refractive surgeries because they are confident about it."<br>
"Because the reference values of the previous five separate examinations are not coaxial, there may be error. But the reference values of five iDesign examinations are coaxial, and the error is very small."</p>
