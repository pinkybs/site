          <a href="" class="qu">What is laser vision correction? </a>
          <p class="aw">Laser vision correction is a surgery that improves visual acuity by changing the shape of the cornea (the transparent tissues covering the front of the eyeball) using laser. It is generally known as LASIK (initials of the medical term "laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis").</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faqItem grey">
          <a href="" class="qu">What is excimer laser? </a>
          <p class="aw">Excimer laser is a form of ultraviolet laser. In the iLASIK Procedure surgery, it is used for precise remolding of corneal stroma. In an individualized surgery guided by iris registration and wave-front aberration using VISX excimer laser, corneal remolding can provide accurate correction of myopia, hyperopia and astigmatism.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faqItem">
          <a href="" class="qu">What is femtosecond laser? </a>
          <p class="aw">Femtosecond laser is a form of infrared laser. It is used to make corneal flap in LASIK surgery. Using IntraLase®, the fifth generation femtosecond laser iFS®, to create corneal flap.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faqItem grey">
          <a href="" class="qu">What is Wavefront Guided technology?</a>
          <p class="aw">Wavefront guided technology measures by comparing the difference between the actual light path and ideal light path passed your eyeball optical system. The precision of WaveScan® wavefront LASIK surgery that identifies and measures individual visual impairment is more accurate than eyeglasses and contact lens. The three-dimensional Wavefront Guided images obtained are transmitted to VISX excimer laser so that you can undergo accurate individualized laser correction surgery.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faqItem">
          <a href="" class="qu">How does the iLASIK Procedure treat your eyes?</a>
          <p class="aw">The iLASIK Procedure is a unique combination of IntraLase® and Advanced CustomeVue® technologies. IntraLase® technology creates even and consistent corneal flap using iFS femtosecond laser in LASIK. Then Advanced CustomeVue® technology obtains individual visual impairment in your eyes by WaveScan® Wavefront Guided system, generates three-dimensional Wavefront Guided image, and transmits to VISX excimer laser, so that you can undergo laser vision correction surgery.</p>

        <div class="faqItem grey">
          <a href="" class="qu">Does the iLASIK procedure bring you pain? </a>
          <p class="aw">Patients can experience pain postoperatively but usually not very serious. The surgery is conducted under anesthesia induced by anesthetic eye drops, and therefore is not so painful. You will feel a little bit of pressure, which lasts less than 1 minute, when corneal flap is being created. </p>
        </div>
        <!--<div class="faqItem">
          <a href="" class="qu">Does iLASIK bring you blindness? </a>
          <p class="aw">Among results reported from over 15 million of iLASIK surgeries globally, no case of blindness has been reported. </p>
        </div>-->
        <div class="faqItem">
          <a href="" class="qu">Can the iLASIK Procedure ensure that you achieve the visual acuity of 1.0 after surgery? </a>
          <p class="aw">Like any other surgery, we cannot guarantee any given result. Surgical efficacy depends on conditions of individual patient, and most patients achieve pre-operative best corrected visual acuity or better after surgery. </p>
        </div>
        <!--<div class="faqItem grey">
          <a href="" class="qu">Can the iLASIK Procedure improve your night vision? </a>
          <p class="aw">Yes. Clinical studies suggest 4 times of patients are more satisfied with night vision after the iLASIK Procedure compared to that with eyeglasses and contact lens before surgery. </p>
        </div>-->
        <div class="faqItem grey">
          <a href="" class="qu">What does it mean if your visual acuity is higher than 1.0? </a>
          <p class="aw">1.0 is the current standard for good visual acuity. However, clinical studies suggest patients undergoing the iLASIK Procedure can achieve a visual acuity above 1.0. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="faqItem">
          <a href="" class="qu">What is the success rate of the iLASIK Procedure? Do you need to wear eyeglasses after surgery? </a>
          <p class="aw">Success rate varies from center to center. In the Parkway Eye Centre (Singapore), 99% of patients do not need to wear eyeglasses after the iLASIK Procedure.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faqItem grey">
          <a href="" class="qu">What will be the result if your eyes move during surgery? </a>
          <p class="aw">Excimer laser is equipped with three-dimensional eye ball tracker. It can locate and track the pupil, and compensate for slight movement of the eye ball, ensuring that treatment is completed accurately. </p>
        </div>
        <!--<div class="faqItem grey">
          <a href="" class="qu">Is the iLASIK Procedure suitable for patients over 40 years old? Do you need to wear presbyopic glasses after surgery? </a>
          <p class="aw">When you are over 40 years old and have difficulty in short-distance reading, you can have the one and only monovision the iLASIK Procedure that is approved by the US FDA. The surgery achieves full correction in your dominant eye, but allows mild undercorrection in the non-dominant eye, so that you don't need to wear presbyopic glasses after surgery. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="faqItem">
          <a href="" class="qu">Is the effect of the iLASIK Procedure everlasting? </a>
          <p class="aw">Yes, most patients above 18 years old have stable refraction state and have the shape of their cornea changed permanently after surgery. Only a few patients will have refractive regression. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="faqItem grey">
          <a href="" class="qu">When can you resume your normal activities?</a>
          <p class="aw">You can resume your normal activities immediately after surgery. Most patients resume work and driving 24 hours after surgery. To ensure safety, avoid touching your eye balls and water sports within 1 month after surgery. </p>
        </div>-->
        <div class="faqItem">
          <a href="" class="qu">Does the iLASIK Procedure have any side effects? </a>
          <p class="aw">In the first few months after surgery, common transient side effects include dry eye, photo-sensitivity, glare and halo. Most of these resolve without management. It takes 3 – 6 months for visual acuity to completely stabilize after surgery. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="faqItem grey">
          <a href="" class="qu">Is the iLASIK Procedure approved by the FDA? </a>
          <p class="aw">Based on clinical studies, the US FDA approves the iLASIK Procedure for treatment of myopia, hyperopia and astigmatism, and confirms that that it is safe and effective. </p>
        </div>
        <!--<div class="faqItem">
          <a href="" class="qu">Are there any data of the iLASIK Procedure results? </a>
          <p class="aw">FDA studies suggest, 1 year after the iLASIK Procedure:
            100% of patients pass driving test without eyeglasses or contact lens
            98% of patients achieve the uncorrected visual acuity of 1.0 or better
            70% of patients achieve the uncorrected visual acuity of higher than 1.0
            In addition, many patients suggest they obtain clearer and better full-day vision quality than that with eyeglasses or contact lens before surgery. </p>
